A python module is developed to provide access to control the car using its \ac{sdk} with short and easy commands in Python. The user only has to connect a client, where the Python module is installed, to the car's Wi-Fi \ac{ap}. Each Python command is translated to a string that is sent to the car's IP address and a predefined port. This string is then interpreted by the firmware running on the microcontroller that controls the car. The commands used for steering the car are interpreted as a vector, which is used to control the direction.\\
