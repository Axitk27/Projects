 abstract = {Chapter 1: ESP32 Microcontroller -- Chapter 2: I2S Audio -- Chapter 3: Mesh Communication -- Chapter 4: TTGO T-Watch V -- Chapter 5: BLE Beacons -- Chapter 6: LORA and Microsatellites -- Chapter 7: Email and GR Codes -- Chapter 8: Websocket, Webserial, and Webdashboard -- Chapter 9: MQTT -- Chapter 10: Managing Images -- Chapter 11: ESP32-Cam Camera -- Chapter 12: Control Apps -- Chapter 13: Remote Control Motors -- Chapter 14: Remote Control ESP32-Cam Robot Car.



Although Wi-Fi communication is incorporated in many internet-based applications, knowledge of alternative communication protocols is vital for optimal project development with a microcontroller, such as the ESP32. This book focuses on communication protocols for the ESP32 microcontroller with illustrative projects ranging from a Bluetooth Low Energy beacon communicating with your smart wristwatch to Long Range (LoRa) communication between microsatellites circling 550km above the Earth and an ESP32 microcontroller in your home. Just as there are different communication protocols, there are different ESP32 microcontroller formats. You'll examine the features of several ESP32 microcontroller formats, which enable the optimal combination of communication protocol and ESP32 format to achieve the requirements of a project. Several of the communication protocols and ESP32 formats have only been available in the last few months or years, making the book very relevant. Each chapter focuses on a communication protocol and is stand-alone, so they can be read without having to start from the beginning of the book. The chapters are loosely grouped into short- and long-range communication, image management for transmission to a webpage or a remote LCD screen, and the required apps and IoT techniques for remote control of an ESP32-CAM robot vehicle. The advantages of each communication protocol correspond to different project types. You will: Study the MESH communication and the ESP-NOW protocols with communication between ESP32 microcontrollers without a Wi-Fi connection Review email communication projects with a generation of quick response codes to instruct an ESP32 to control a connected device Look at the ESP32-CAM module built around a 2M-pixel camera for streaming images with the WebSocket protocol to a remote ESP32 Control an ESP32-CAM robot car through remote communication over the internet with image streaming to an Android tablet or mobile phone.},

@incollection{Cameron.2023b,
 abstract = {The ESP32 microcontroller has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth functionality, Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) communication, independent timers, analog to digital and digital to analog converters (ADCs and DACs), capacitive touch sensors, and a Hall effect sensor. The ESP32 microcontroller includes two 240MHz cores, each with a Tensilica Xtensa 32-bit LX6 microprocessor. The ESP32 microcontroller is incorporated in several formats, ranging from a development board to an integrated watch with touchscreen and GPS. The variety of different ESP32 formats illustrate the diversity of projects centered on the ESP32 microcontroller. The selected formats are the ESP32 DEVKIT DOIT, the TTGO T-Display V1.1, the TTGO LoRa32 V2.1 1.6, the ESP32-CAM, the TTGO T-Watch V2 with GPS, and the M5Stack Core2 module (see Figure 1-1). All formats incorporate the ESP32-D0WDQ6 chip, with either revision 1 (ESP32 DEVKIT DOIT and ESP32-CAM) or revision 3, except the TTGO LoRa32 V2.1 1.6, as the ESP32-PICO-D4 chip replaced the ESP32-D0WDQ6 chip of the TTGO LoRa32 V1.0. The selected range of ESP32 module formats is not exhaustive, but does represent a comprehensive range of modules available with the ESP32 microcontroller.},

@article{Gfrerrer.2008,
 abstract = {Mecanum wheels are used when omnidirectional movability of a vehicle is desired. That means that the vehicle can move along a prescribed path and at the same time rotate arbitrarily around its center. A Mecanum wheel consists of a set of rolls arranged around the wheel axis. In this paper we describe in detail the geometry of these rolls. We derive simple canonical parameterizations of the roll generating curve and the roll surface itself. These parametric representations reveal the geometry of the roll. With their help we can easily find an approximation of the roll surface by a torus for manufacture purposes. Based on the roll parametrization we study the kinematics of a vehicle featured with Mecanum wheels.},
