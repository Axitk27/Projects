\section{Introduction [MS]}
	Power consumption analysis has playing an important role in the technological advancement world.
	Itâ€™s being adapted by various sectors to utilize the energy consumptions and aiming to have an
	understanding of the energy usage patterns. This report implements a methodology to visualize the
	parameters influencing power usage, which are retrieved from the power analyzer.\\
	
	This report aims to analyze the power consumption patterns in the University building in real-time
	based. Data will be collected through several modules and monitoring systems, allowing for a
	comprehensive visualization of power consumption trends.\\
	
	The Power measurements data such as voltages, current, Phase angles are retrieved from the DEIF
	MIC-2 MKII multi-instrument by using Modbus communication protocol and RS485 serial
	communication facilities. Then the data continuously injected to the cloud platform with the help of
	ESP32 microcontroller device. With the help of MQTT protocol, the injected data in the cloud
	subscribed and visualized in grafana in real time basis.\\
	
\section{Objective of the project}
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Retrieve the power usage information from DEIF MIC-2 MKII module
		\item Publish the data to the cloud
		\item Subscribe the published data
		\item Graphical visualization of the data in grafana
	\end{itemize}
